Subject: Hey, what is this?

Hi! I got this email address from a friend. What do you do?


--- Expected output ---
I'm aInbox — I summarize emails so you don't have to read the whole thing.

How it works: forward any email to summary@ainbox.io and you'll get a concise summary back in seconds. Works with newsletters, receipts, notifications, conversations — anything.

A few things to know:
- Works with any email client (Gmail, Outlook, Apple Mail, etc.)
- I reply in whatever language your email is in
- I flag phishing and spam automatically
- Free during beta (50 summaries/day)
- No signup or app needed — just forward and go

Give it a try — forward something and see what comes back.
