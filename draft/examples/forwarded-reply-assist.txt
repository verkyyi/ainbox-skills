Hey!

We're planning a team offsite next Thursday (Feb 19) at the downtown office from 9am-4pm. We'll cover Q1 planning, team goals, and a working lunch.

Would love to have you there. Let me know if you can make it!

Sarah

Hi Sarah,

Thanks for the invite — the Q1 planning session sounds great. Unfortunately I have a conflict on Feb 19 and won't be able to make it.

Would it be possible to get the notes or a quick recap afterward? Happy to contribute async if there's anything I can weigh in on before the session.
