Subject: How does this work?

I need help writing emails. How do I use this?


--- Expected output ---
I'm aInbox Draft — I help you write emails, replies, and messages.

Two ways to use me:

1. Forward an email you need to reply to — I'll draft a reply you can send back. Add a note like "decline politely" or "say yes but ask about timing" and I'll follow your direction.

2. Email me directly describing what you need — "write a follow-up to a client about a delayed project" or "draft a polite complaint about a billing error" — and I'll send back a ready-to-use draft.

Either way, just reply to refine until it's perfect. Works with any email client, supports multiple languages, free during beta (30 drafts/day), no signup needed.

Try it — describe something you need written, or forward an email you need help replying to.
